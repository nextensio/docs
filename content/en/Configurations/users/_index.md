## Users

Add user             
:-------------------------:
![](/configurations/users/user_add.jpg) 

* User ID: A unique email id of the user

* User Name: A descriptive name

NOTE: In the next update, Nextensio will start supporting federation with
customer's Identity Provider / LDAP and at that point the list of users can be
exported from customer's Identity Provider instead of manually configuring here

For attributes, please refer to the [overview on policy and attributes](/architecture/policyattr.html) 
and [access control](/architecture/accesscontrol.html) details about [configuring attribute editor](../attributeeditor.html)
